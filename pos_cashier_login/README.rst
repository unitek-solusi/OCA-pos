This module will require for the cashier to "sign in", in the PoS, each time a new order is created. This can reduce the likelihood that a the user creates an order under a different cashier. It works best if PoS barcodes and PIN (Settings > Users > Point of Sale) are used on users but it is also possible to switch the cashier using the selection widget. In this way the users can quickly scan themselves and a PIN will be requested only when a different user is switched.

Usage
=====

After installing the module the cashier will have to be selected before each order.

With scanner:

* Set Barcode and PIN on all users (Settings > Users > Point of Sale)  which will work in the PoS.
* Print User Labels (Setting > Users > Print)
* Scan label in PoS to start a new order

Without scanner:
* Switch/or select same using the cashier selection widget (top left) to start a new order
