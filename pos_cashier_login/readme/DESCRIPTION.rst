This module will require for the cashier to "sign in", in the PoS, each time a new order is created. This can reduce the likelihood that a the user creates an order under a different cashier. It works best if PoS barcodes and PIN (Settings > Users > Point of Sale) are used on users but it is also possible to switch the cashier using the selection widget. In this way the users can quickly scan themselves and a PIN will be requested only when a different user is switched.
